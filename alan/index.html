  <p><b>Who was Alan Turing?</b>  
    <br>
  Alan Turing was a British mathematician, computer scientist, and logician who made significant contributions to:
 </p>
<ul>
  <li>Theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence</li> 
  <li>Codebreaking during World War II, particularly cracking German naval ciphers</li> 
  <li>Designing one of the first stored-program computers, the Automatic Computing Engine </li>
  <li> Mathematical biology, predicting oscillating chemical reactions</li>

</ul>
    <p>Turing's work was often classified, and he faced persecution for being gay. He died in 1954 at age 41, with his death ruled a suicide. Despite this, Turing's legacy has grown, and he is now recognized as a pioneer in computer science and a hero of World War II. He appears on the current Bank of England Â£50 note and has been named the greatest person of the 20th century by the BBC.</p>

  <p> <b>What contributions in technology did Alan Turing make?</b>
<br>
  Often considered the father of modern computer science, Alan Turing was famous for his work developing the first modern computers, decoding the encryption of German Enigma machines during the second world war, and detailing a procedure known as the Turing Test, forming the basis for artificial intelligence.
