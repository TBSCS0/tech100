  <br>
  <p> From 1967 to 1977, Hopper served as the Director of the Navy Programming Languages Group in the Navy's Office of Information Systems Planning. She developed validation software for the programming language of COBOL and its compiler as part of a COBOL standardization program for the entire United States Navy.</p>
  <br>
  <p> Hopper was the first to devise the theory of machine-independent programming languages, and used this theory to develop the flow-matic programming language and cobol, an early high-level programming language still in use today. She was also one of the first programmers on the Harvard Mark I computer.</p>
