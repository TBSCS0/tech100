  <h2> The evolution of technology - Apple and Blackberry phones</h2>
  <p> 
    The BlackBerry phone series has undergone significant evolution over the years, starting from its humble beginnings in the early 2000s. The first BlackBerry phone, the BlackBerry 850, was released in 1999 and featured a physical keyboard and email capabilities. The early 2000s saw the introduction of the BlackBerry 8700 and 8800 series, which added color screens and improved web browsing. The mid-2000s brought the Curve series, which introduced a more consumer-friendly design and added multimedia capabilities. The Bold series, introduced in 2008, featured a more robust design and improved keyboards. The Storm series, launched in 2008, was the first BlackBerry phone with a touchscreen, but it was met with mixed reviews. The Torch series, launched in 2010, brought a more modern design and improved web browsing. The Z10 series, launched in 2013, marked a major shift towards a more modern design and a new operating system, BB10. The Passport and Classic series, launched in 2014 and 2015 respectively, focused on productivity and functionality. The DTEK series, launched in 2016, prioritized security and privacy. The KEY series, launched in 2017, brought back the physical keyboard and introduced new features such as a fingerprint sensor. Finally, the latest BlackBerry phones, such as the KEY2 and KEY2 LE, continue to prioritize security and productivity while incorporating modern features like AI-powered assistants. Blackberry phones failed to adapt to the dynamic of the market. They were too complacent, too stubborn, and too slow to respond to the changing needs and preferences of their customers so people just stopped using them.

  <p>  The iPhone debuted in 2007 with a 3.5-inch touchscreen and multi-touch interface. The iPhone 3G added 3G connectivity, and the iPhone 4 introduced a new design with a stainless steel frame and glass front and back. The iPhone 5 introduced a larger 4-inch screen, and the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus featured larger screens and Apple Pay mobile payments. The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus introduced water resistance and dual-lens cameras, while the iPhone X marked a major design shift with an edge-to-edge OLED screen and facial recognition authentication. The latest iPhone series, including the iPhone 12 and iPhone 13, have continued to refine the design with improved cameras, faster processors, and advanced features like Night mode and ProRAW photo editing. People use apple until now-a-days because they respond really fast, and they are very good at atending their clients wishes.

  <p> most people who used blackberry phones in the past, they probably use other devices which are more updated, they work better than old phones because by time we disinvolved more technology, blackberry phones failed because they are not as updated as other phones. </p>
